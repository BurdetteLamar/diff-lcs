Ruwiki 0.7.0
------------
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki written in Ruby. It supports both CGI and
WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. Additionally, it supports
project namespaces, so that two pages can be named the same for differing
projects without colliding or having to resort to odd naming conventions.
Please see the ::Ruwiki project in the running Wiki for more information.
Ruwiki 0.7.0 has German and Spanish translations available.

Quick Start (CGI)
-----------------
1. Place the Ruwiki directory in a place that your webserver can execute CGI
   programs and ensure that ruwiki.cgi is executable on your webserver.
2. Point your web browser to the appropriate URL.

Quick Start (WEBrick)
---------------------
1. Run ruwiki_servlet (ruwiki_servlet.bat under Windows).
2. Point your web browser to <http://localhost:8808/>.

Configuration
-------------
There are extensive configuration options available. The Ruwiki WEBrick
servlet offers command-line options that simplify the configuration of Ruwiki
without editing the servlet; use ruwiki_servlet --help for more information.
