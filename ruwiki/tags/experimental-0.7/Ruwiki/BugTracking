= Ruwiki 0.7.0 Bug Tracking
This page is for tracking bugs in Ruwiki. Only bugs from recent distributions
are tracked. In addition to this source-based bug tracking, there is the
[http://rubyforge.org RubyForge]
[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=407&group_id=84&func=browse bug tracker]
for Ruwiki.

Those interested in Ruwiki development may also find the Ruwiki::To_Do list
useful.

----
== Open Bugs
* 0.6.2: Not all formatting is applied consistently. The token rankings may need adjusting. Eivind Eklund has suggested a scheme that may help with this, but it will require architectural adjustment and will probably slow things down.

----
== Closed Bugs
* 0.7.0: Fixed a link detection problem in \[wikiword] format. Thanks to [mailto:eivind@FreeBSD.org Eivind Eklund] for the patch.
* 0.7.0: Fixed a problem with &lt;pre&gt; paragraph detection and generation.
* 0.7.0: Fixed a problem with &lt;p&gt; generation.
* 0.7.0: [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=197&group_id=84&atid=407 Run-away ruby on some links in default distribution]. This may be related to a runaway header problem that was reported to me on IRC some time back that I believe has been fixed. Please advise.
* 0.6.1: Projects aren't created appropriately.
* 0.6.1: Saving without editing (or repost) appears to cause problems. A fix has been applied to attempt to address this. Pages that have not been changed will not be saved.
