= Ruwiki
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki written in Ruby. It supports both CGI and
\WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. Additionally, it supports
project namespaces, so that two pages can be named the same for differing
projects without colliding or having to resort to odd naming conventions.
Please see ::Ruwiki for more information.

The current version is 0.6.2. German and Spanish translations have been added
in this version. Note that the APIs for Ruwiki should not at this point be
considered stable, but will be stable in 1.0.

Projects:
* ::Default
* ::Ruwiki

Please go to ::Ruwiki if you are unfamiliar with the concept of Wikis in
general. If you want to play with \WikiFormatting, use the Ruwiki::SandBox.
