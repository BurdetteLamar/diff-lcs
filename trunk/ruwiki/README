Ruwiki 0.8.0
------------
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki-clone written in Ruby. It supports both
CGI and WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. This Wiki differs
from most other Wikis in that it supports projectt namespaces, so that two
topics may be named the same for differing projects without colliding or
having to resort to odd naming conventions. Please see the ::Ruwiki project
in the running Wiki for more information. Ruwiki 0.8.0 has German and
Spanish translations available.

Quick Start (CGI)
-----------------
1. Place the Ruwiki directory in a place that your webserver can execute CGI
   programs and ensure that ruwiki.cgi is executable on your webserver.
2. Point your web browser to the appropriate URL.

Quick Start (WEBrick)
---------------------
1. Run ruwiki_servlet (ruwiki_servlet.bat under Windows).
2. Point your web browser to <http://localhost:8808/>.

Configuration
-------------
There are extensive configuration options available. The Ruwiki WEBrick
servlet offers command-line options that simplify the configuration of
Ruwiki without editing the servlet; use ruwiki_servlet --help for more
information.
