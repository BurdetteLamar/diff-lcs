Ruwiki 0.6.1
------------
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki written in Ruby. It supports both CGI and
WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. Additionally, it supports
project namespaces, so that two pages can be named the same for differing
projects without colliding or having to resort to odd naming conventions.
Please see ::Ruwiki in the running Wiki for more information.

Quick Install (CGI)
-------------------
1. Place the Ruwiki directory in a place that your webserver can execute CGI
   programs. Ensure that ruwiki.cgi is executable on your webserver. You may
   wish to protect templates/, data/, and lib/ from casual access.
2. Modify the following lines in ruwiki.cgi:
    wiki.config.webmaster  = ...
    wiki.config.title      = ...
3. Point your web browser to the appropriate URL.

Quick Install (WEBrick)
-----------------------
1. Modify the following lines in ruwiki_servlet.rb:
    $config.webmaster  = ...
    $config.title      = ...
2. Run ruwiki_servlet.rb to start a WEBrick instance on localhost:8808 with
   ruwiki bound to the root path (e.g., http://localhost:8808/).
3. Point your web browser to the appropriate URL.
