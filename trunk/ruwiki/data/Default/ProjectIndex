#EHDR
= Ruwiki
Ruwiki is a simple, extensible Wiki written in Ruby. It supports both CGI and
\WEBrick interfaces, templates, and CSS formatting. Additionally, it supports
project namespaces, so that two pages can be named the same for differing
projects without colliding or having to resort to odd naming conventions.
Please see ::Ruwiki for more information.

The current version is 0.7.0. Several fixes have been made to text
preservation. More importantly, there has been an API change to plugins.
Please read Ruwiki::Extending_Ruwiki for details.

German and Spanish translations have been added in this version. Note that the
\APIs for Ruwiki should not at this point be considered stable, but will be
stable in 1.0.

Projects:
* ::Default
* ::Ruwiki

Please go to ::Ruwiki if you are unfamiliar with the concept of Wikis in general. If you want to play with \WikiFormatting, use the Ruwiki::SandBox.
