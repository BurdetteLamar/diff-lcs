== Open Bugs
* 0.6.2: Not all formatting is applied consistently. The token rankings may need adjusting. Eivind Eklund has suggested a scheme that may help with this, but it will require architectural adjustment and will probably slow things down.
* 0.6.2: [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=197&group_id=84&atid=407 Run-away ruby on some links in default distribution]. This may be related to a runaway header problem that was reported to me on IRC some time back that I believe has been fixed. Please advise.
