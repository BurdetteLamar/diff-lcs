= Ruwiki 0.6.2 Bug Tracking
This page is for tracking bugs in the Ruwiki project. Because of the extensive
nature of the changes between Ruwiki 0.3.0 and Ruwiki 0.5.0 (and 0.6.x), the
previously listed bugs have been erased.

----
== Closed Bugs
* Projects aren't created appropriately. Fixed in 0.6.1.
* Saving without editing (or repost) appears to cause problems. A fix has been applied to attempt to address this. Pages that have not been changed will not be saved.

----
== Open Bugs
* Not all formatting is applied consistently. The token rankings may need adjusting.
