To add a new page to Ruwiki, all you need to do is come up with a meaningful
title, turn it into a \WikiWord (see WikiMarkup) and Ruwiki will automatically
recognise it as a reference to a page that does not yet exist.

At the end of the new \WikiWord is a hyperlinked question mark; Ruwiki will open
the edit page for the new \WikiWord.
