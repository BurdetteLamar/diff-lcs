= Ruwiki 0.6.1 ChangeLog
Uncompleted to-do items can be found in To_Do. Bugs in Ruwiki are tracked in
BugTracking.

== Version 0.6.1
* Changed Config#data_path to Config#storage_options[:flatfiles][:data_path]. This represents a generalisation of storage type options so that the Config object is not polluted with storage type options. Config#storage_options keys should be the same Ruby Symbol as is used in Config#storage_type.
* Added Config#storage_options[:flatfiles][:extension], based on a request by Chad Fowler. This allows you to have Project/\TopicFile actually stored as Project/\TopicFile.wiki if Config#storage_options[:flatfiles][:extension] is set to <tt>wiki</tt>. The default for Config#storage_options[:flatfiles][:extension] is <tt>nil</tt>.
* Fixed incorrect references. I had been incorrectly attributing [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdoc-wiki RDoc Wiki] to Dave Thomas. RDoc Wiki is by Michael Neumann. However, the project I pulled from <b>is</b> by Dave Thomas, but it's [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rublog RubLog]. Apologies to both developers.
* Added RuwikiTemplatingLibrary documentation.
* Internationalized messages, except for the templating library.
* Added configuration API for future work surrounding features. The existing wiki is mostly feature complete. Additional features (such as access controls) will be added through the feature interface.
* Fixed project creation.
* Fixed problems with WikiWord links.
* TODO Added Wikipedia-style Wiki links (\[[list of words]]).

== Version 0.6.0
* Added Ruby mailing list reference support (e.g., \[ruby-talk:12345]).
* Reorganised the code (again) to better support alternative frontends. Based, in part, on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rublog RubLog] by Dave Thomas. (Reference corrected in 0.6.1.)
* Added a [http://www.webrick.org WEBrick] servlet interface. Based, in part, on the WEBrick servlet interface provided with RubLog by Chad Fowler.
* Added templates, using the [http://rdoc.sourceforge.net RDoc] template.rb library.
* Changed the default topic to be \ProjectIndex instead of \DefaultProject.
* Added a new \WikiWord format, \Wiki_Word_with_Spaces.
* Completed lots of Ruwiki documentation.
* Updated the save page.
* Fixed a problem with the linking of project specific pages.

== Version 0.5.0
* Reorganized the code significantly to be easier to edit and extend.
* Added abbreviation capabilities.
* Cleaned up a lot of tokenizing code.
