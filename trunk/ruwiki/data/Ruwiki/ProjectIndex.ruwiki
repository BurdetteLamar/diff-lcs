page!content:	= Ruwiki 0.8.0
	This is the \ProjectIndex page for Ruwiki. For any given project, the
	\ProjectIndex topic will be the default topic for plain project links.
	
	== Features and Information
	* This wiki supports a variety of WikiFeatures that you may be interested in. The rules for WikiMarkup are similar to some other wikis, but there are a few unique markup capabilities in Ruwiki.
	* Configuring_Ruwiki is simple.
	* Extending_Ruwiki is almost as simple.
	* Who wrote Ruwiki? Read the LicenseAndAuthorInfo.
	
	== Tracking Ruwiki Development
	The development progress of Ruwiki is kept primarily in the wiki
	itself, but the services of [http://rubyforge.org RubyForge] are used
	as well.
	* The BugTracking page in Ruwiki keeps track of open and closed bugs in Ruwiki. Bugs can also be found in the \RubyForge [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=407&group_id=84&func=browse bug tracker] and [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=408&group_id=84&func=browse Support Requests].
	* The To_Do list keeps track of major development goals for Ruwiki. Items for this list can be found on \RubyForge in [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=410&group_id=84&func=browse Feature Requests] and [http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=409&group_id=84&func=browse Patches].
	* The [http://rubyforge.org/forum/?group_id=84 Ruwiki Public Forum] exists, but it rarely used. It is recommended to use the new mailing list, [http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ruwiki-discuss ruwiki-discuss] ([http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/ruwiki-discuss/ archives]), instead.
	* There is a mailing list to track CVS changes: [http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ruwiki-checkin ruwiki-checkin] ([http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/ruwiki-checkin/ archives]).
